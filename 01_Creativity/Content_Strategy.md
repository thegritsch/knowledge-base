Yes — this is exactly the right framing: **authentic expression as a beacon**, not chasing mass-market “success.” If you treat online presence as a kind of _playful experiment_, it both lowers pressure and maximizes resonance.

Here’s a **platform-by-platform strategy** tailored to your inclinations:

---

## 🎹 YouTube (_the gritsch_)

**Role:** Your “home base,” a library of depth + creativity.  
**Content ideas:**

- **Mini-performances**: short piano clips (1–5 mins), raw and intimate rather than polished perfection.
    
- **Reflections**: 3–7 minute videos where you share a thought on perception, spirituality, or connection.
    
- **Experiments**: “Improvisation inspired by X” (a memory, a theme, a poem).
    
- **Behind the scenes**: glimpses of practice, daily life, walks, musings.
    

**Tone:** Gentle, thoughtful, unforced. Viewers should feel they’re entering your space, not watching a show.

**Connection tactic:**

- End each video with a subtle invite: _“If you resonate with this, join me in my small circle (Discord/Telegram).”_

## 🎥 Twitch (or YouTube Live)

**Role:** _Playful immediacy_ — your “living room” for live interaction.  
**Content ideas:**

- **Casual piano streaming**: practice + chat. Mistakes welcome.
    
- **Q&A / deep talks**: short sessions where you riff on a theme from chat.
    
- **Cross-play**: invite someone from Discord/YouTube to join a call for conversation.
    
- **Occasional “fun” streams**: reacting to interesting media, or exploring philosophy/games together.
    

**Tone:** More spontaneous and light than YouTube. A place where your _playful side_ balances your depth.

---

## 📸 Instagram

**Role:** _Visual diary_ — showing your aesthetic + vibe.  
**Content ideas:**

- Piano snippets (30–60 sec reels).
    
- Photos of nature walks, books, piano sheets, moments of beauty.
    
- Captions with short reflective lines or playful thoughts.
    

**Tone:** A mix of personal + aesthetic. Show warmth, not curation.

**Connection tactic:** Use stories for casual engagement (polls, short notes, mini-reflections).

---

## 💬 Discord

**Role:** _Intimate community hub_ — your private circle.  
**Content ideas (channels):**

- 🎹 **Music & Creativity** – share recordings, improvisations, invite others to share theirs.
    
- 🌱 **Reflections** – space for philosophy, presence, insights.
    
- 🌀 **Casual corner** – memes, light banter, keep it human.
    
- 🎙️ **Voice sessions** – occasional live hangouts (music + talk).
    

**Tone:** Small, warm, curated. Make joining slightly effortful (short intro message) to filter.

---

## 🧭 Overall Strategy

- **Start with YouTube as anchor** → post authentic pieces (music + thought).
    
- **Use Twitch/Live for playfulness** → lighter interactions, direct resonance.
    
- **Instagram for aesthetic presence** → approachable snapshots.
    
- **Discord for intimacy** → those who resonate deeply enter here.
    

Think of it as **a funnel that filters for resonance**:  
YouTube → Instagram → Discord → real friendship/connection.

## 🔑 How to Present Yourself

- **Authentic, not polished** → mistakes in piano, pauses in speech, all welcome.
    
- **Depth + playfulness** → balance serious reflection with humor/lightness.
    
- **Invitation, not performance** → instead of “watch me,” frame as “share this space with me.”
    

Example self-description (for channel/Discord):

> “This is a space for music, reflection, and authentic presence. Not mass-market, not a show — just experiments in expression and connection. If you’re playful, curious, and kind, you’ll feel at home here.”

⚖️ **Result:**  
You create a _small web of resonance_, not a big following. The right people (including women with the “Jinnytty archetype” energy) will find you, because the vibe filters them in.
