Alright — here’s a **sequential healing roadmap** designed specifically for your shutdown origin story at age 13–14, accounting for your earlier silencing and multiple exiled parts.  
It’s built to **reintroduce safety one domain at a time**, so you don’t overload your nervous system or re-trigger collapse.

# 🛤 Healing Roadmap for Reversing the 13–14 Shutdown

---

## **Stage 1 – Safety in the Body** _(2–6 weeks)_

Goal: Undo body shame, reclaim physical presence, and reestablish a sense of **ownership over your body**.

**Practices:**

- **Daily somatic grounding**: 5–10 min of lying down, one hand on chest, one on belly, slow sigh exhales.
    
- **Touch reclaiming**: self-massage of arms, legs, and neck while affirming:  
    _“This body is mine. No one gets to take it without permission.”_
    
- **Body-neutral activities**: walking, stretching, or light movement focused on sensation, not performance or fitness.
    
- **Mirror exposure**: Look into a mirror and meet your own gaze daily for 30–60 seconds. No self-critique—only noticing.
    

**Milestone to move on:** You can inhabit your body for 5+ minutes without strong shame or urge to disappear.

## **Stage 2 – Voice Safety** _(3–6 weeks)_

Goal: Rebuild the capacity to **speak without fear of ridicule or attack**.

**Practices:**

- **Private voice play**: hums, vowel sounds, nonsense phrases, recorded and deleted.
    
- **Truth whispers**: say one real feeling aloud each day, even in private: _“I feel lonely”_, _“I want rest”_.
    
- **Low-stakes social talking**: ask a cashier a question or greet a neighbor—short, controlled interactions.
    
- **Parts dialogue aloud**: speak as your Innocent Child, Dark Masculine, and Cognitive Self in turn, just for you.
    

**Milestone to move on:** You can speak aloud alone without physical tension spiking and engage in tiny public speech moments without major shutdown.

---

## **Stage 3 – Social Safety** _(4–8 weeks)_

Goal: Carefully rewire the belief that **connection always leads to betrayal or danger**.

**Practices:**

- **1:1 safe contact**: brief, low-pressure interactions with carefully chosen safe people.
    
- **Co-regulation**: spend time around calm, nonjudgmental others without the need to perform.
    
- **Boundary micro-reps**: say “No” or “I’d prefer…” in low-stakes settings (coffee order correction, declining a flyer).
    
- **Track safety cues**: after each interaction, note: Did anything bad happen? This builds evidence against the old map.
    

**Milestone to move on:** You can leave an interaction with neutral or positive feelings rather than rumination or shame.

---

## **Stage 4 – Desire Safety** _(4–8 weeks)_

Goal: Remove the link between **wanting** and **feeling disgusting or unworthy**.

**Practices:**

- **Desire journaling**: write 3 small things you want daily (can be simple like “sunlight” or “a new book”).
    
- **Micro-asking**: request tiny things from safe people (e.g., “Can you pass me that pen?”) to retrain the “ask → safe” link.
    
- **Revisit the idealized figure**: not the person herself, but the qualities you admired—see them as _human_ and possibly _within you_.
    
- **Parts conversation**: ask each exiled part: _“What do you want, if it were safe to want?”_
    

**Milestone to move on:** You can acknowledge a want without immediate shame, disgust, or collapse.

---

## **Stage 5 – Visibility Safety** _(Ongoing)_

Goal: Let authentic parts be **seen** without triggering the old “visibility = danger” reflex.

**Practices:**

- **Creative micro-shares**: post a piece of art, writing, or music anonymously or in a small, supportive group.
    
- **Gradual audience increase**: over months, share with larger or less familiar audiences in safe contexts.
    
- **Body-voice integration**: record yourself speaking truth while in a grounded posture, then watch/listen back with compassion.
    
- **Celebrating exposure**: after any visibility moment, consciously anchor safety:  
    _“I was seen and I survived.”_
    

**Milestone:** You can let others witness your authentic expression without severe anxiety or next-day shutdown.

## 🔄 Integration Tips

- **Move only when ready**: Don’t advance until the milestone of the current stage feels solid.
    
- **Keep old practices alive**: Don’t drop body and voice work when moving to social safety—stack them.
    
- **Repair after overwhelm**: If you do get flooded, step back to the previous stage for a few days.
