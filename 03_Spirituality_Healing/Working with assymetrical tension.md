Got it — thank you for clarifying. If **22 ms RMSSD / 34 ms SDNN** is one of your _best_ readings, then your baseline autonomic balance is indeed **heavily sympathetic-dominant**. That aligns with your body asymmetry, trauma history, and flare-up pattern.

Here’s a **compact daily routine (15–20 min)** designed specifically for people with chronic low HRV and asymmetrical tension. It’s structured to progressively shift the system into parasympathetic tone:

---

## 🔹 Daily HRV-Boosting Routine

### 1. **Reset Posture & Asymmetry (3–4 min)**

- Lie on your back (knees bent, feet flat, arms open).
    
- Notice differences between left and right.
    
- Slowly roll your head left-right, then slide one knee to the side and back, alternating.  
    👉 Goal: signal to the nervous system that both sides of the body are safe and movable. (Feldenkrais-style).

### 2. **Coherent Breathing (5 min)**

- Breathe at **5.5 breaths per minute** (~5 sec inhale, ~5 sec exhale).
    
- Light nasal breathing, belly + ribcage expansion.
    
- If comfortable: pause briefly after exhale (1–2 sec).  
    👉 This maximizes vagal tone, directly raising RMSSD.

### 3. **Vagus Nerve Stimulation (3–4 min)**

Choose one:

- **Humming**: deep humming on exhale, feel vibration in chest and face.
    
- **Chanting**: long, slow “OM” or any resonance.
    
- **Gargling** (with water) vigorously for 30 sec.  
    👉 These mechanically activate vagus branches and calm inflammation.

### 4. **Solar Plexus Release (2–3 min)**

- Place hands on upper abdomen, just below sternum.
    
- Inhale: let belly rise.
    
- Exhale: gently press in with hands, imagine melting tension.
    
- Option: add soft sigh on exhale.  
    👉 Directly relaxes diaphragm, reduces referred chest/neck pain.

### 5. **Closing Grounding (2–3 min)**

- Sit or lie with hands on thighs.
    
- Feel whole-body contact with floor/chair.
    
- Slowly scan from feet → legs → pelvis → torso → head, noticing both sides equally.  
    👉 This anchors parasympathetic state, prevents rebound into stress.
    

---

⏱️ **Total: ~18 min**

- If short on time: do steps 2 + 3 only (8–10 min).
    
- Track HRV before and after sessions — even a small acute bump is a good sign.

### 🔹 Long-term strategy

- Consistency > intensity. Aim for **daily practice**.
    
- Over weeks, look for:
    
    - RMSSD gradually rising toward 20–30+ ms baseline.
        
    - More symmetry in muscle tone.
        
    - Flare-ups becoming less intense/shorter.

Would you like me to **expand this into a progressive 4-week plan** (adding layers like cold exposure, somatic unwinding, and light movement), so you can systematically test what improves your HRV and symptoms the most?
