Thank you for your trust, Martin. Given your introspective lifestyle, nervous system sensitivity, and experience with both meditation and emotional trauma, I’ll recommend **practices that work with the body gently, safely, and deeply**, rather than techniques that force catharsis or re-trigger trauma.

Below is a **structured plan** of exercises across several categories: _body-based_, _breath-based_, and _awareness-based_, drawn from somatic therapy, polyvagal theory, and trauma-informed meditation.

## 🔹 DAILY SOMATIC REGULATION PRACTICES (15–30 mins total)

### **1. Orienting (3–5 mins, polyvagal grounding)**

**Purpose:** To signal safety and bring the nervous system out of hyperarousal.  
**How to do it:**

- Sit or stand in a quiet space.
    
- Slowly let your gaze wander the room, noticing colors, shapes, shadows.
    
- Let your head and neck turn freely.
    
- Say silently: _“I’m here. It’s now. I am safe enough.”_
    
- Let your exhale be soft and long.
    

This activates your **ventral vagal** system by mimicking the way mammals scan for safety.

### **2. Voo Sounding (3 mins, vagal toning)**

**From: Dr. Peter Levine, Somatic Experiencing**

**How to do it:**

- Inhale gently.
    
- On exhale, say _"Voooooo..."_ in a low pitch, like foghorn.
    
- Feel the vibration in your chest.
    
- Repeat for 3–4 cycles.
    

**Why it helps:** Vibrations stimulate the vagus nerve and release tension from the diaphragm, which holds a lot of fight/flight energy.

---

### **3. Butterfly Hug (2–5 mins, bilateral self-soothing)**

**From: EMDR protocols**

**How to do it:**

- Cross your arms over your chest like a hug.
    
- Tap gently left-right-left-right with your hands on your shoulders.
    
- Breathe slowly.
    
- As you tap, you can say to yourself: _“It’s okay to feel what I feel. I am here now.”_
    

This calms the midbrain and soothes emotional overwhelm without bypassing it.

### **4. Pendulation with Felt Sense (5–10 mins)**

**From: Somatic Experiencing**

**How to do it:**

- Sit and bring your attention to a body area of _discomfort, tightness or anxiety_. Just observe.
    
- Now shift to a _neutral or pleasant_ area of the body (feet, hands, breath). Stay here a bit.
    
- Go back and forth slowly between the two.
    
- Notice how your system “pendulates” or oscillates between activation and calm.
    

**Why it works:** It teaches your body to move between survival states and safety without overwhelm. It restores **resilience**.

## 🔹 ADDITIONAL WEEKLY PRACTICES

### **5. Trauma-informed Yoga (2–3x per week)**

Look for slow, grounding sequences (like Yoga with Adriene’s [trauma-sensitive videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=yoga+with+adriene+trauma) or _Yin Yoga_).

Avoid intense breathwork or backbends for now—they can overstimulate a dysregulated system.

---

### **6. Coherent Breathing (daily, 5–10 mins)**

**How to do it:**

- Inhale for 5 seconds, exhale for 5 seconds.
    
- Do not force depth.
    
- Do this for 5–10 minutes once or twice per day.
    

This creates **heart rate variability coherence**, balancing sympathetic and parasympathetic tone.

Use apps like _Breathwrk_ or _The Breathing App_ if helpful.

---

### **7. Journaling the “unfelt”** (2x/week)**

- Sit with the vague tension you describe.
    
- Without trying to solve or analyze, describe what it feels like as sensation:
    
    - "Like a knot in my gut."
        
    - "Buzzing behind my eyes."
        
    - "Coiled energy in my throat."
        
- Ask gently: _“What does this part of me need?”_
    
- Write whatever arises, without filtering.
    

Over time, this builds access to parts of you that were locked away.

## 🔹 IF INTENSE EMOTION SURFACES

Use this protocol:

1. Stop the practice and **feel your feet on the ground.**
    
2. Do the **Butterfly Hug** (see above).
    
3. Orient again—look around the room, name 3 things you see.
    
4. Speak to yourself gently:
    
    > “This is just old survival energy. I’m not in danger now. I will move through this.”

## 🔸 Closing Notes

- **Consistency beats intensity**: 15 minutes a day of gentle somatic practice will take you farther than occasional deep catharsis.
    
- **Slowness is safety**: Fast shifts can trigger overwhelm. Allow your system to unfurl in its own time.
    
- **You’re not broken**: The “stuckness” is not a flaw. It’s a sacred intelligence doing its best to keep you safe.

Would you like a printable daily routine or a guided audio/video version of any of these exercises? I can also recommend trauma-aware therapists or group programs in Vienna if you're open to soft interpersonal support later on.
